# nano-birds
App done for the Nano Challenge 3 in Apple Developer Academy PUCPR in which students had to develop and app with the theme "My collection of..." in one week.

This app uses CoreML with a EfficientBNet0 model trained in Python that classifies birds in their species, with 525 different species as option. 
It also uses Apple's CoreData to store the sightings that the user register.
